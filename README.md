- 👋 Hi, I’m @benjaminrust
- 👀 I’m interested in all kinds of things. Technology, non-tech, books (loads of books), bicycles, food (tacos, pasta, (all the carbs))
- 🌱 I’m currently learning fast.ai, pytorch, rust, julia, how to say no to projects
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on just about any project where i can be additive to the end goal
- 📫 How to reach me linkedin.com/benjaminrust is probably the best way or post.news/ferociousoxide
